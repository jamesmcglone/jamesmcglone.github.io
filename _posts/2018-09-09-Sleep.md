As one of the objectives for my [fitness challenge](2018-09-09-Fitness-Challenge.md), getting an average of 8 hours sleep each week is an important part of my new routine. This past week I attended a presentation on [sleep](https://www.facebook.com/events/545539119210379/) presented by Virginie Gabel, a researcher at Stanford University.

Sleep Cycles

two types of cues or cycles that inform our sleep cycle and rest. Misalignment with each other or our routine results in sleep problems (e.g. jet lag, insomnia, teenage (trouble rising) and elderly (early tiredness) sleep challenges)
1. optical / environmental cues
2. circadian body cues

Key take-aways

For better daytime activity:
Wake up with a dawn simulation light
Increase daytime exposure to light (or use a blue enriched white light during the day)
Encourage daily exercise (including walks)
Eat at regular times
Once awake, get out of bed (habitual cue, don't lie in bed)

to get to sleep:
end exercise 4h before bedtime
no alcohol after dinner
no caffeine in the afternoon
only a small nap (better to have none at all)
dim light in room before going to bed
wear blue blocker glasses if using an LED screen at night

to improve sleep quality:
sleep in complete darkness
keep a consistent sleep time (7 days)
sleep in thermoneutrality (cool but not cold)
turn off electronic devices


On Blue Light

- the good:
exposure in morning and during day correlated with higher productivity and energy

- the bad:
exposure damaging to photoreceptors, can induce formation of cataracts and poor eyesight
exposure at night inhibits falling to sleep / quality (cue for daytime)
