## Introduction


Recently I have been mulling over the idea of data compression. At first glance it isn't the sexiest idea out there. While one could appreciate data compression's ability to reduce file size (Increasing the number of songs a device can hold is pretty great!) it hardly compares to the thrill of watching SpaceX rockets take off then land on a moving platform in the ocean. In fact, compression's possibly best known moment in the popular imagination is not 'sexy' at all. The raunchy conceptualization of Pied Piper's middle-out compression algorithm (youtube link here) in hit HBO series "Silicon Valley" is hilarious. However, it doesn't particularly inspire one to seek a deeper understanding of our universe. 


It turns out compression is essential to not only understand more about the world but also such apparantly disparate things such as: creativity, humor, art, music, science, and our various types of learning. In a concise yet inspiring paper, Juergen Schabenhuber laid out his "Formal Theory of Creativity and Fun". (You can view a great presentation he did on the subject at the 2009 Singularity Conference here.) In it he stipulates not only how we as humans go about experiencing all the above concepts but also the formal means to build 'creative agents', i.e. artificial intelligence that can replicate humans' innate capacity to interact creatively with our environment. 


While I intend to write more on the the subject of data compression and learning, especially as applied to artifical intelligence, I'd like to first dive into just how powerful compression is along with its breadth of application. In this post I will focus on how a philosophical concept, Plato's Theory of Forms, can be explained in terms of data compression. Using the 'averageness hypothesis' for facial beauty, I'll also apply this analogy to a real-world example.


Outline:

1. Compression

2. Philosophy

	* Allegory of the Cave

	* Other Concepts: Averageness, Prototypes, Categories, Aristotle, Wittgenstein

3. Example: Beautiful Faces

	* History

	* Sources, explanation of how it works + biological reasons/constraints

	* tying it all together: local versus global forms

4. Implications, Limitations, Final Thoughts

5. Sources and Further Reading



## Plato's Theory of Forms


### Allegory of the Cave.


	What we perceive 'mimics' forms which are beyond this world.


### The Form is an objective "blueprint" for perfection.


### Atemporal, aspacial. Non-physical but also not in the mind. 


### Symposium: Plato talks about Beauty


## Compression


### Basic idea, definition


### Different types: loss-less, and more


### Example of a loss-less data compression algorithm.


Identify patterns and consistencies  > creating classes in OOP? (good for a segue post on OOP and how it can be explained with Theory of Forms)


## What's the connection? Our mind finds connections beautiful. and identifies beautiful, elegant, interesting things that are 'easy on the eyes', easy to compress, or improve on the compression engine by creating new connections.


## Example


### Dataset of 100< faces


### create a composite image


### Is this face more beatiful than majority of faces in dataset?


Local dataset + compression


## Implications


local vs global, biases in garbage data


Learning, improvements on compression engine stimulate sense of reward


ideals, perfection


It turns out compression is 'sexy' after all!
